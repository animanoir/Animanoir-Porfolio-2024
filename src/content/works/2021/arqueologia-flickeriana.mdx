[**Arqueología Flickeriana**](https://arqueologia-flickeriana.vercel.app/) is an innovative tool designed to explore photographs uploaded on any given day in any state of Mexico.

The inspiration for this tool predates its submission to a public call for projects. I find myself captivated by the allure of photos uploaded to this service, believing them to hold a more natural and human essence, significantly more spontaneous than the overly curated and often artificial images found on mainstream social media platforms. To me, the genuine quality of these images contrasts sharply with the pretense prevalent in social media photos—a discrepancy I find deeply unsettling.

Moreover, I'm intrigued by the concept of simultaneity, the idea of multiple events occurring in different places at the same time. This tool provides a snapshot, not just of individual experiences, but also of the collective emotional and visual landscape across different states in Mexico. It's an exploration of space and time, a digital archaeology of sorts that uncovers the layers of everyday life as captured by ordinary people.

##### Special thanks to the individual who shared the call for projects with me, helping to bring this concept to a wider audience.

In a world increasingly defined by filtered experiences, "Arqueología Flickeriana" serves as a refreshing counterpoint, inviting us to ponder the complexities and simplicities of human existence, one photograph at a time.
