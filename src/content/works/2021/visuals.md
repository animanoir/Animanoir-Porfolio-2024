I have a deep-seated passion for creating animated visuals set to music, a venture that allows me to marry my technical prowess with my artistic inclinations. Utilizing tools like Max/MSP for real-time audio processing, Blender for 3D modeling, and GLSL for custom shader programming, I craft experiences that transcend conventional boundaries.
