<a target="_blank" href="https://metaxis.digital">metaxis.digital</a> is an online magazine that serves as a confluence of philosophy and futurism, dissected and discussed from a metamodern perspective.

I founded the platform because I'm deeply committed to the belief that **information about new ideas should be not just accessible, but also free and collaborative**. This drive aligns with my overarching goal for profound understanding, merging my professional skills in technology with my passion for intellectual exploration. That's why I've built an open invitation into the core architecture of the project: anyone is welcome to contribute, whether it's through writing articles or working on the source code, which is engineered using **React** and **Gatsby**.

For those intrigued by the cross-disciplinary explorations we undertake—from ethical algorithms to the futurology of consciousness—know that this platform aims to be more than just a repository of ideas. It's an active community focused on the synthesis of deep thought and actionable insight, all anchored by a metamodern framework that seeks to go beyond mere categorization into an understanding of complex interconnectedness.
