[Metaxis.digital](https://metaxis.digital/) is an online platform I founded that blends **philosophy** and **futurism** through a metamodern lens. My commitment to making intellectual discourse **accessible, free, and collaborative** led me to design the project's core architecture as open-source. This means anyone can contribute to its **React** and **Gatsby**-engineered codebase.

The platform incorporates the [Are.na API](https://www.are.na/degrees-degrees-bullet-period/metaxis-digital) for seamless content updates, exemplifying my ability to integrate third-party APIs effectively. More than just a repository of ideas, Metaxis.digital serves as an **active community** focused on the synthesis of deep thought and actionable insights, revealing my knack for building engaged digital ecosystems.
