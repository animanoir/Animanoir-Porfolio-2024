# How to disappear completely

Some months ago I finally took the plunge and **deleted all my social media accounts**. It was a really hard decision since I knew that for many people I would ontologically cease to exist, and I'd probably miss the "interesting" content I used to consume on them. I've never been a person that _needs_ the attention of as many people as possible, so I didn't expect that much of a downside, but the media I used to find "inspiring" (obviously curated by myself and not the algorithm) would be something hard to find again since stupid people tend to **centralize everything in social media nowdays**, which most of the time is behind some kind of paywall (either $ or your data).

After some time, I must admit I'm completely oblivious to whatever is happening in the mainstream sphere of digital society—thankfully, I have always given a shit about it since nowadays it is more than obvious that Guy Debord's _Society of the Spectacle_ is a complete and sad reality. But, at the same time, this sense of **freedom** of thought and action does feel invigorating—it is kind of an _awakening_ after being trapped in such a horrible chamber of illusion and brainwashing. Being invisible never felt so good...

# Social media is venom that poisons everyone—in fact the whole Internet

Even though I feel a beautiful quality of liberation, I started to notice how the market dynamics of social media have affected absolutely every corner of the internet and, therefore, “real life." Of course this is more than obvious and is a topic well researched by people like **Geert Lovink**, **Ekaitz Cancela**, and many more. Nowadays you don´t need to have a PhD to know it-what I´m trying to point out is that we are indeed living in a politicized, confrontational society that is not, in my particular view, healthy at all, and the majority of people ignore this fact. Actually, they rejoice! Like coprophiliacs, they eat & dance between digital shit! Thinking this is "human nature", which of course is not-we are being sabotaged.

> Social media services are absolute venom and atrophy people's attention and perception of the world beyond sanity.

# Is there no escapatory?

I believe the internet is worsening with each day, as I pointed out already, making people complete brainwrecks & incapable of rational thinking and _feeling_. That's why, at least for me, **the only solution is to completely destroy all your social media profiles**.

Recently I went to a philosophical talk about the dangers of social media and there were people that, sadly, defended the "reality" of their profiles as "theirselves". "Reality" by itself is a quite deep topic, which I prefer to see through the Buddhist lens, but to avoid digressing too much, saying your Instagram profile is "the real you" is quite ignorant-**people are shaped by Capitalists interests**...

And this is a well known fact! **Apathy & indifference are modern day diseases which many people seem to carry with pride**, which is exactly the function of an ideology: When it is taken for granted—"the way life simply is". Of course, **this is plain wrong**. In a following post I´ll share some alternatives to mainstream social media that satisfies our inherent need for recognition in a more healthy way...
