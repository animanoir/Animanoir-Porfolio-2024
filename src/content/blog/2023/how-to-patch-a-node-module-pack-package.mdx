## How to Seamlessly Modify Node Modules

Sometimes the packages we rely on might not work perfectly for our needs. Today, we'll dive into how you can modify `node_modules` effortlessly using `patch-package`.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Identify the Module to Modify:** For this demonstration, I'm adjusting `astro-embed` which resides in the `node_modules` directory. Always ensure you navigate through the module's folders to pinpoint the exact code segment you're looking to modify.

2. **Make Necessary Adjustments:** My objective was simple: change the `src` attribute of the `img` tag to leverage _hq720.jpg_ over _hqdefault.jpg_:

```js
// Sample code showcasing the modification...
const posterURL = poster || `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/${videoid}/hq720.jpg`;
```

3. **Set Up Patch-Package:** Install the required packages:

```bash
yarn add -D patch-package postinstall-postinstall
```

4. **Generate a Patch:** Execute the command tailored to the file/module you adjusted:

```bash
yarn patch-package @astro-community/astro-embed-youtube
```

This command creates a `patches` folder in your repository, capturing the changes. Rest assured, your existing setup remains unharmed.

  width={1280}
  height={720}
  quality={"max"}
  formats={["webp"]}
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="blog-image"
/>

5. **Deploy with Confidence:** To ensure deployments use the patched version, update your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "patch-package"
  }
}
```

There you have it! You're all set to deploy your website with the patched module intact. To explore more on `patch-package`, visit their [official repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package).

## Pursuing Top Quality

In web development, we always aim for the highest quality, both in coding and design. But sometimes, even the best tools have some flaws.

Take the `astro_embed` library, for example. It's a great tool that lets us **embed videos from sites like YouTube or Vimeo** into Astro's `mdx` files. However, I noticed an issue with the thumbnail quality.

YouTube often uses this _hqdefault_ .jpg thumbnail:

<Picture
  src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZEMEo9fJ94g/hqdefault.jpg"
  alt={"Óscar A. Montiel — Galería Municipal de Querétaro"}
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  quality={"max"}
  formats={["webp"]}
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="blog-image"
/>

But there's a better quality version, _hq720.jpg_:

<Picture
  src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZEMEo9fJ94g/hq720.jpg"
  alt={"Óscar A. Montiel — Galería Municipal de Querétaro"}
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  quality={"max"}
  formats={["webp"]}
  decoding="async"
  loading="lazy"
  class="blog-image"
/>

The second one clearly looks better. However, `astro_embed` uses the first one by default. So, I decided to tweak the library to use the better-quality thumbnail.
